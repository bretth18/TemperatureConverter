Please Read:


TemperatureConverter is a basic Android App that converts different temperature units
TemperatureConverter is compatible with Android 2.2+

2.2/2.3 USERS: Info does not work, it produces a Force Close message when selected. 3.0/3.1/3.2/4.0/4.0.2/4.0.3 Does not have this issue, due to the fact that these versions of Android have the Action Bar.

NOTE: If you plan to re-destribute your own personal version of my work, please notify me first!
